# One Chat App!

The idea of the project is to create a **SINGLE** spontaneous **CHAT** where the messages will not be saved anywhere.


## Built with

The entire app was built on Nest.js to take advantage of its auth, middleware, and robustness. Chat is supported in a simple Socket.io

## Set up in your local
First you need to clone the repository, run this in your terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/juanikitro/One-Chat-App.git
    cd One-Chat-App

Then you need to install all backend dependencies:

    cd server
    npm i

And finally you are going to run the client with live server extension and the backend with:

    npm run start:dev
